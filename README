What is the Cursor example program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is an example user interface using the EBookBackendSqliteDB
cursor API.

The code in src/cursor-example.c displays a user interface object which
uses most of the existing cursor features (if not all of them).


Build Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To build the cursor example you need:
  o GTK+ 3.4 or later
  o GIO (and glib/gobject) 2.32 or later
  o EDS 3.9.90 (the latest code drop including cursor APIs)

As a reminder, the EDS tarbal can be downloaded here:
    http://people.gnome.org/~tvb/evolution-data-server-3.9.90-openismus-18-06-2013.tar.xz


Building the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To build, follow these easy steps:

  tar -jxf cursor-0.1.0.tar.bz2
  cd cursor-0.1.0/
  ./configure
  make

There is no need to install the cursor example program.


Running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The example requires that EDS services be running, and
that the XDG environment variables be the same for the
server processes as they are for the example program.

So, let's take the example that you installed EDS in
the default system prefix '/usr/local', and let's run
EDS in such a way that it will create data in a temporary
directory that we can remove later on.

First, setup the relevant environment variables:

  export XDG_DATA_HOME=/home/username/tmp_evo
  export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/username/tmp_evo
  export XDG_CACHE_HOME=/home/username/tmp_evo

Now start the EDS services and run them in the background:

  /usr/local/libexec/evolution-source-registry &
  /usr/local/libexec/evolution-addressbook-factory -r &

Now you can run the cursor example in the same environment:

  cd cursor-0.1.0/
  ./src/cursor-example

By default, the example will start by populating a temporary
address book with all of the vcards found in the 'cursor-0.1.0/data'
directory.

Alternatively, you can pass a relative or absolute path to 
a directory containing ".vcf" vcard files, like so:

  ./src/cursor-example /path/to/directory/containing/vcards
